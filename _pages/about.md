My research examines the brain mechanisms of cognitive function in humans. I use cognitive science, large-scale electrophysiology, and noninvasive brain stimulation to understand the acquisition, maintenance, transformation and deletion of different kinds of information in the brain. My work also attempts to inform how symptoms of neuropsychiatric illness relate to cognitive function, and uses noninvasive brain stimulation to develop newer therapeutic approaches.

I am a Postdoctoral Associate working with [Rob Reinhart](http://reinhartlab.org) at Boston University. I completed my PhD in Psychology (concentration: Brain, Behavior & Cognition) at Boston University. Previously, I worked with [Devarajan Sridharan](https://cns.iisc.ac.in/sridhar/) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India.
